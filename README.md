There is a 7x7 board and one piece for each player. On each turn current player makes two moves: 1. Moving his/her piece to one of its four neighbours (Move can be vertical or horizontal. Players can’t move to a square removed by the opponent, outside of board or to opponent’s square) 2. Removing a square from board (It can’t be an already removed one or a square with a piece on it) Game ends when one of the players has no place to move.
